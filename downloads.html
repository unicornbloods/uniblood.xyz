						Copyright (C) 2019 UnicornBlood aka Dakotah2468
						All Rights Reserved unless otherwise explicitly stated.<br><br>

					 By downloading this project you agree to the terms and conditions
					 detailed below. <br><br>


																	TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br><br>

						 0. Definitions. <br><br>

						 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
					 works, such as semiconductor masks. <br><br>

						 "The Project" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
					 License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees", "users" and
					 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations. <br><br>

						 "The Author" refers to the original creator(s) of this project and it's
					 source code.  <br><br>

						 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
					 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
					 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
					 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work. <br><br>

						 A "covered work" means either the unmodified Project or a work based
					 on the Project. <br><br>

						 To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
					 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
					 under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
					 modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution
					 (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in
					 some countries other activities as well. <br><br>

						 To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
					 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a
					 computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. <br><br>


						 1. Redistribution <br><br>

						 Public propagation of this project or parts of it requires you to
					 exclusively use the official links provided by the author. This means that
					 independently hosting a copy of this project and propagating it using this
					 hosted version is prohibited. The usage of link monetization services on
					 redistribution is strictly prohibited. <br>
						 Websites and Blogs collecting projects similar to this project are
					 invited to ask for explicit permission before adding this project to
					 its database. <br><br>


						 2. Private Modifications <br><br>

						 Users are allowed to create private modifications of this project
					 without explicit permission. Redistribution of these modified versions
					 however require explicit permission by the author of the original project.
						 See section 3 for more information about public modifications. <br><br>


						 3. Public Modifications <br><br>

						 Public redistribution of a modified version of this project is forbidden,
					 unless explicit permission is given. <br><br>


						 4. Usage of parts of this project as part of another, original project <br><br>

						 Using parts of this projects source code as part of another, original
					 project requires explicit permission from this projects author. <br>
						 Furthermore this project, its author and the parts used have to be
					 clearly credited. Additionally any means of monetization on this modified
					 version are prohibited unless explicit permission is given.<br><br>


						 5. Liability <br><br>

						 The project is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express
					 or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,
					 fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the
					 author or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other
					 liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from,
					 out of or in connection with the project or the use or other dealings in the
					 project.<br><br>


						 6. Disclaimer <br><br>

						 This License and its terms are subject to change and review at any time
					 by this projects author.
